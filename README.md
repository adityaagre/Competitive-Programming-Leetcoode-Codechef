Maintaining records of my solutions to problems I found most challenging.


1. Duplet
2. Ties
3. Count nodes equal to avg of subtree: leetcode: tree, recursion, pair return, pair.
4. Add two numbers : recursion, linked list, handling long int in int.  note: We can't store the etire sum, so calculate sum digits directly.
5. Double number: recursion, linked list,  handling long int in int. This is similar to last problem but better, also, we have implemented this without using stack.
6. max_index_diff really good array problem.
7. sorted_rotated array: array rotation.
8. MD_Riev: prime numbers and palindromes. interesting property.
9. 0009-palindrome-number: Simple palindrome question, but interesting point regarding nagative palindromes' existence.

1. 3_sum_closest. 
2. subset_1 : Basic regression
3.
