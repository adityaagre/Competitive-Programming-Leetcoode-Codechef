Maintaining records of my solutions to problems I found most challenging.


1. Duplet
2. Ties
3. Count nodes equal to avg of subtree: leetcode: tree, recursion, pair return, pair.
4. Add two numbers : recursion, linked list, handling long int in int.  note: We can't store the etire sum, so calculate sum digits directly.
5. Double number: recursion, linked list,  handling long int in int. This is similar to last problem but better, also, we have implemented this without using stack.
6. max_index_diff really good array problem.
